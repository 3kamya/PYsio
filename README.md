##  Overview  
PYsio is a Python-based application that helps physiotherapists manage, track, and analyze patient progress.  
It was inspired by observing how traditional note-taking and manual tracking systems can be *haphazard and time-consuming*.  
Seeing how my sister (a physiotherapist) struggled with spreadsheets, voice notes, and scattered paper files motivated me to build a cleaner, centralized solution.  

PYsio brings everything into one dashboard — voice-to-text logging, progress visualization, and patient management — all built entirely in Python.  
##  Features  
-  **Patient Management:** Add, view, and edit patient details  
-  **Voice-to-Text Notes:** Record therapist notes and convert them to text  
-  **Keyword Triggers:** Detect key phrases like *pain*, *improvement*, *mobility*  
-  **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualize recovery trends and generate word clouds  
-  **Cloud Integration (Future):** Sync data with Firebase or PostgreSQL  
-  **Local Storage:** Save all data to CSV for easy access and backup.

Through PYsio, I aim to strengthen my skills in modular programming, file handling, and data visualization — areas I have familiarity with.
The integration of speech recognition and Firebase cloud storage are new concepts for me, and they represent major learning goals for this project.
I also want to understand how different components (input, processing, and storage) communicate in a scalable system architecture.
